        <h2>Steps</h2>

            <ol>
                <li>Combine the beef and marinade ingredients and marinate for about 1 hour.</li>
                <li>Some fresh rice noodles come as large sheets, while others are already cut. If you have the sheets, slice the rice noodles so they're about 1 inch wide. If the noodles are very stiff and stuck together, bring a wok full of water to a boil, and add the noodles. Blanch them for 30 seconds to loosen. Transfer to an ice bath and drain thoroughly.</li>
                <li>Heat your wok over high heat until smoking, and add 1 1/2 tablespoons oil to coat the wok. Add the beef and sear until browned. As long as your wok is hot enough, the meat shouldn't stick. Set aside. Add 1 1/2 tablespoons more vegetable oil to the wok. Add the ginger to infuse the oil with its rich flavor for about 15 seconds. Add the scallions.</li>
                <li>Spread the noodles evenly in the wok and stir-fry on high for about 15 seconds. Add the Shaoxing wine around the perimeter of the wok.</li>
                <li>Next, add the sesame oil, soy sauces, pinch of sugar and the seared beef. Stir-fry, making sure your metal wok spatula scrapes the bottom of the wok. Lift the noodles in an upward motion to mix well and coat them evenly with the sauce.</li>
                <li>Add a bit of salt and white pepper to taste (taste the noodles before adding salt). Add the bean sprouts and stir-fry until they are just tender. Serve!</li>
            </ol>
        <h3>Tips</h3>
            <p>A useful tip is to freeze the beef before slicing, until it's firm but not solid. This makes slicing the beef much easier!</p>
            <p>Important: Heat should remain <b>as high as possible at all times</b> when cooking this dish.</p>
